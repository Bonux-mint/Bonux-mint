    <p>
        <b>1:</b> <b>Phishing</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><i><b>How It Works: </b></i></u> An attacker sends emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, like banks or tech companies. These communications typically include a request to click on a link or provide personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        <u><i><b>How to Defend Against It:</b></i></u>Always verify the authenticity of such messages. Check for signs of phishing like misspelled words, urgent language, and suspicious links. Never click on links or provide personal information unless you’re certain the request is legitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><br>
        <b>2:</b> <b>Pretexting</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><i><b>How It Works:</b></i></u>The attacker creates a fabricated scenario to obtain information. For instance, they might pretend to be a tech support representative who needs your login details for “security verification.”
    </p>
    <p>
        
        <u><i><b>How to Defend Against It:</b></i></u>: Be cautious of unsolicited requests for information. Verify the identity of anyone asking for sensitive data and always use official contact methods to follow up on such requests.

    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3:</b> <b>Baiting</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><i><b>How It Works:</b></i></u>The attacker offers something enticing, like free software or a prize, to lure victims into revealing information or downloading malicious software
    </p>
    <p>
        <u><i><b>How to Defend Against It:</b></i></u>: Avoid downloading software or accepting offers from unknown sources. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true, and always use reliable and trusted sources for downloads.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4:</b> <b>Tailgating</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><i><b>How It Works:</b></i></u>An attacker gains physical access to a restricted area by following someone with authorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u><i><b>How to Defend Against It:</b></i></u>Be mindful of who is around you when entering secure areas. Don’t hold doors open for people you don’t know, and be vigilant about who is gaining access to secure locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>5:</b> <b>Impersonation</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><i><b>How It Works:</b></i></u>The attacker pretends to be someone you trust, such as a colleague or family member, to gain access to information or systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u><i><b>How to Defend Against It:</b></i></u>Always verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information, even if they claim to be someone you know. Use additional methods of verification if needed.

      <b>1.</b> <b><u>Understanding RF Vulnerabilities:</u></b> Ethical hackers must be aware of common vulnerabilities associated with RF communications, such as weak encryption or outdated protocols. Identifying these weaknesses helps organizations secure their wireless networks.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

<b>2.</b> <b><u>Penetration Testing of Wireless Networks:</u></b>Ethical hackers often conduct penetration tests on RF networks (like Wi-Fi and RFID systems) to evaluate their security. This includes testing for unauthorized access, eavesdropping, and replay attacks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> <b><u>Spectrum Analysis:</u></b>Proficient ethical hackers use spectrum analyzers to monitor RF signals, identifying unauthorized devices or interference. This helps organizations maintain a secure and reliable wireless environment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> <b><u>Compliance and Regulations:</u></b>Ethical hackers must be knowledgeable about relevant regulations (e.g., FCC guidelines, GDPR) regarding RF communications. Ensuring compliance not only enhances security but also protects organizations from legal issues.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b> <b><u>Educating Stakeholders:</u></b>An important role of ethical hackers is to educate stakeholders about the risks associated with RF technologies. This includes training on secure usage practices and the potential threats posed by poorly secured RF systems.
